## Description
This is a portfolio that showcases my group projects from my coding boot camp. There are currently four pages total. The interface is also mobile responsive.

## Built With
HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and React Router. 

## Installation
If you wish to install a copy locally, copy the SSH link from the project page, and in your CLI run `git clone ` with the SSH right after.

## Acknowledgements

## Future Updates
I used CSS animations for Browser Party that I would like to incorporate into this page.
